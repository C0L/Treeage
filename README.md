# Triage
Treeage is an infinitely expandable user experience that displays a root paper, which can be found by searching the author:
  -> Search to find an author's most cited paper.
  -> From that root paper, branch out to see the most relevant papers that cite that root paper
  
  -> Click on a paper to center it and display the author, title, and abstract
  
  -> Click on the outermost paper to expand the tree
  
  -> See the number of times that paper has been cited displayed in the center of each paper

This was developed at SD Hacks 2019 with Mara Casebeer
